# Experiment assignment 4 - Jakarta Persistence Architecture (JPA)

As hand in, you must add a markdown file called dat250-expass4.md, which you should hand in via Canvas by posting a link to it.

In particular, you should write about:

- technical problems that you encountered during installation and use of Java Persistence Architecture (JPA) and how you resolved
- a link to your code for experiment 2 above. Make sure the included test case passes!
- an explanation of how you inspected the database tables and what tables were created. For the latter, you may provide screenshots.
- any pending issues with this assignment that you did not manage to solve
